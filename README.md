# Memory-game-with-Arduino
This project is a memory game made on Tinkercad. LCD screen and remote control are used. In the logic of the game, you need to keep in mind the LEDs that turn on randomly and press the number of each color on the remote control when it is your turn. At the end, you continue the game by getting the right or wrong answer.
